  position: Production Manager
  blurb: NextFaze’s prodigal son, Dan puts the prod in producer. With a long history in the games and mobile industry, Dan has had his nose to the grindstone enough to know how to whip the team into action and results. On a personal level, his goals include changing a nappy in under 1 minute, and assembling a 3D printer that actually works.

- name: Ric Santos

  position: Software Engineer - iOS
  blurb: A developer with a professional streak, Ric strives to demonstrate that it’s possible to be a coder and a manager at the same time. Ric’s desire to see polished projects delivered on time and within budget keeps clients happy, staff on their toes, and our bank balance healthy. An avid motor enthusiast, we’re all surprised that he bought a scooter. We were not surprised when he crashed it.

- name: Ben Tilbrook
  pic: ben
  position: Software Engineer - Android, iOS
  blurb: No one else at NextFaze is driven by such rabid motivation to get software right as Ben. A mobile developer for years, Ben has seen the rise and fall of many mobile platforms, written software for almost all of them, and at one time or another been forced to slog through thousands of lines of source code to fix their inherent errors. Despite that, his passion for developing high quality apps remains untarnished. We salute you, Ben.

- name: Andreas Wulf

  position: Software Engineer - iOS
  blurb: After receiving his first Macintosh Plus at age 10, Andreas has been administering systems and coding software since his early high school years. Day-to-day, he keeps the NextFaze servers humming, our internal systems buzzing, and the mobile apps churning. When he’s not attached to a computer, he’s out bargain-hunting and keeping the office well stocked in cheap snacks, caffeine, and hardware.

- name: Andrew Williams

  position: Software Engineer - Android, iOS
  blurb: Seemingly unable to stop writing code, Andrew is the NextFaze equivalent of the boisterous rockstar. Trashing the metaphorical hotel room, Andrew consistently surprises everyone with innovative side projects, reusable libraries, and high-grade internal systems that remain in use for years. We suspect a long-term caffeine addiction, but no one wants to risk mentioning it.

- name: Alex Waters
  pic: zuck
  position: Android Developer
  blurb: Also known as AW the 3rd, Alex brings some Android smashing, Java yodelling, keyboard canoodling skills to the team. Currently studying a degree in impossibility (B.Eng (Mechatronic) + B.Sc (Biomedical)), he will no doubt drop out at some stage in the near future to develop the T1000 for Cyberdyne Systems

- name: Luke Fielke
  pic: luke
  position: Android Developer
  blurb: Affectionately know as the Fielkinator, Luke joins us here at NextFaze as the newest member of team Android. A self proclaimed techy, Luke has a fantastic knowledge pool to draw from, backing up his bachelor of comp sci skill set with a black belt in networking and a masters degree from the school of hard knocks. Willing to take on any non-iOS task, Luke also has one of the lucrative office window seats.

- name: Michael Drozdowski
  pic: droz
  position: International Bon Vivant
  blurb: Bachelor of the Laws, nerd of the beers and connoisseur of the coffees, Droz joined the team to ‘hang around some real code monkeys.’ He must like the place, because he’s been here long enough to make it on the website! Droz spends his days weilding JIRA and Xcode, wrestling the objective sees, and brewing quite possibly the finest coffee this side of the Himalayas.

- name: Zak Barbuto
  pic: zak
  position: Web Developer
  blurb: Armed with a Bachelor of Science in Computing & Digital Media, Zak brings an unending passion for JavaScript and all things web to the NextFaze team. When he’s not at the office, Zak is usually still bound to a computer, trying his hand at development or consuming far more than the recommended daily dose of video games.

- name: Dan Silk
  pic: dans
  position: Software Engineer - iOS, Android
  blurb:  > 
    Dan is our cross-platform app magician. He really can do anything! Dan’s background is in gaming, not just playing them, but actually making them! He’s credited for his work on Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Republic Hero (Wii, PS2, PSP) as well as Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (Wii, PS2, PSP) and so many more! You can generally find NextFazer’s skylarking at Dan’s desk either talking code, or cooling down beside his blade-less fan.

- name: Kane O'Riley
  pic: kane
  position: Android Developer
  blurb: Spending a majority of his time tearing apart Android from the ground up, Kane is a self-taught developer that lives and breathes the platform. Kane sees Android development as not only a job but a favourite past-time, developing just as much at home as he does at the office, with his name on plenty of indie developed titles.

- name: Jeff Cressman
  pic: jeffc
  position: Web Developer
  blurb: NextFaze's resident Emberite. A JavaScript explorer and fermenter of things, Jeff keeps the Meeco front-end looking spick and span. Often found drinking some green and questionable juice from a jar that he claims gives him superhuman abilities and immortality.

- name: James Limmer
  pic: james
  position: Web Developer
  blurb: James is currently balancing his NextFaze work with his keen interest in machine learning and finishing up a univeristy degree in Comp Sci. We hope that with his developing skillset, he will build a robot that simultaneously replaces Alex *and* gives massages. Favourite colour - "Fallow". 

- name: Shane Woolcock
  pic: shane
  position: iOS Developer
  blurb: Shane is an iOS, née Java developer. This about-face shows through in other facets of his life, with his Ingress faction-change request finally coming in - he is now very correctly a memeber of the Resistence, leaving the dark and horrible world of the Enlightened in the same place he left his Java credentials.   

- name: Paul Robinson
  pic: paulr
  position: Web Developer
  blurb: Often (mistakenly) credited with the fall of the Roman Empire, Paul nevertheless has an interest in using Malbolge to create modern progressive apps. Also, whenever he opens a terminal window, his computer says "quack".
