# Email Disclaimer
---

To save bytes, NextFaze company email messages should have the brief statement in the footer:

> NB: If you received this message in error, please let us know, as it may contain confidential information. For the purposes of the [SPAM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE) Act 2003, this email is authorised by NextFaze Pty Ltd, and not the Flying Circus. REF: http://goo.gl/TmRvc

An interpretation and further clarification of the disclaimer is below:

## Confidentiality/Legal professional privilege

> If you received this message in error, please let us know, as it may contain confidential information.

This message and any attachments, or any part of it is intended solely for the named addressee. Reading, printing, distribution, storing, commercialising or acting on this transmission or any information it contains, by anyone other than the addressee, is prohibited.

If you have received this message in error, please destroy all copies and notify NextFaze by replying to the sender, or emailing contact@nextfaze.com.

This message may contain confidential information, and/or copyright material of NextFaze or third parties. NextFaze is not responsible for any changes made to a document other than those made by NextFaze, or for the effect of the changes on the document’s meaning.

You should only re-transmit, distribute or commercialise the material if you are authorised to do so. Any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender. You may not rely on this message as advice unless subsequently confirmed by an authorised representative of NextFaze.

Email disclaimers of this type can be traced back to disclaimers featured in fax messages from lawyers, brokers, major corporations and government agencies. The confidentiality notice is an attempt to say that the content of the email is confidential and that it should not be read by anyone other than the intended recipient.  In practice a disclaimer may have value by demonstrating that the recipient – intended or otherwise – was alerted that the content of the message was copyright and might be of confidential nature.

## SPAM Act 2003

> For the purposes of the SPAM Act 2003, this email is authorised by NextFaze Pty Ltd

The notice in the footer to the effect that the company authorises the message brings the message within certain exemptions from the SPAM Act. Without that statement, some of the company’s email messages would fall under that Act and would breach various of its obligations. While not every email needs to include this statement by including it in all communications we avoid the risk omitting it when it is needed.

I recall the [hoo-ha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV4v-3i5pPU#t=22s) when the SPAM Act came in, and the proliferation of these email signature footers; I still think it added more spam then it stopped..

## Compliance with the SPAM Act 2003

All email messages sent from company email accounts must comply with the [Spam Act 2003](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Search/SPAM).  This means that commercial electronic messages should not be sent except to email lists or groups that have been established specifically for the purpose of buying or selling goods or services.

Commercial electronic messages i.e. those which include solicitation to buy or sell goods or services, may only be sent from company email accounts if:

- The consent of the recipient can be construed, a functional unsubscribe facility allows the recipient to withdraw their consent at any time, and any requests to unsubscribe are actioned within 5 days; or
- the message relates to goods or services supplied by the company and is sent to current or former clients, or members of current or former client companies.

SPAM can be reported by anyone to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) by any of the methods listed at: <http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_310301>
